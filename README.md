Presenting "Hidden Sword" – a 3D animation I created in Blender! ⚔️✨
This scene depicts a mysterious hidden area where an ancient sword lies concealed, waiting to be discovered. I focused on lighting, atmosphere, and cinematic storytelling to bring the environment to life.
👉 The challenge? I made this on a non-high-end system, proving that passion and creativity matter more than hardware! 💪🔥
